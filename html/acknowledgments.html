    <h1>Actimetre System</h1>
    <p>Actimetre is short for "Activity Metre". It is intended to measure the activity of lab animals, typically rats in cages, using commodity electronic components. For a hardware cost of less than $10 per cage, the system can record 6 axes of activity (acceleration XYZ and gyroscope XYZ) at up to 100Hz.
      A centralized dashboard helps monitor and manage the system, which can theoretically contain up to 35000 sensors.
      The entire system is fairly robust to disruption, except the Central component which is assumed to be highly available. Installation and configuration requires some amount of technical knowledge.</p>
    <p>A detailed description of the system is available <a href="Actimetre%20Technical.pdf">here</a>. Instructions for installation are <a href="Actimetre%20System%20V2.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Actimetre System was created by Boris Lamotte D'Incamps and Jay Han in the Spring of 2023, when Jay left his high-paying job for some time off and Boris was stuck debugging his I2C driver on a Raspberry Pi. Jay's idea of a time off was to write low-level C code, and Boris' way to get unstuck was to hire Jay as an intern (read: feed him). The system grew during the following few months to become the distributed system in place today.</p>
